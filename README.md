# Building a GatsbyJS Theme - Part Three

## Designing and configuring our Layout

This is part three in a multi-part tutorial series on building your own Gatsby theme from scratch.

Please checkout the [Introduction](https://billyjacoby.dev/intro-to-gatsby-themes), [Part One](https://billyjacoby.dev/building-a-gatsbyjs-theme-part-one), and [Part Two](https://billyjacoby.dev/building-a-gatsbyjs-theme-part-two) of this series if you haven't yet, as we will be picking up right where we left off at the end of part two.

The finished code for this portion of the tutorial can be found on my github repo [here.](https://github.com/billyjacoby/gabsty-theme-tutorial/tree/part-three)

Here's what we'll be tackling in this part of the tutorial:

- Style our current theme to look like a blog
- Initialize a new Gatsby theme
- Demonstrate how to use multiple Gatsby Themes in a single website
- Utilize component shadowing to override components from our theme

Considering that it's been a while since I've been working on this theme lets begin by running a simple `yarn upgrade` and seeing if we break anything.

Luckily (as of writing this at least) everything still works. So lets get to it then!

## Styling our current theme

## Initialize a new Gatsby theme

## Use both themes in our site

## Shadow the about page that came from the Blog theme
